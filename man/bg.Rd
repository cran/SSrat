\description{
Background data of the children, complementary to the files with the rating
data Ss96.rat, Ss97.rat and Ss98.rat. This data file contains 205
observations of 4 variables. Measurements of these Dutch primary school
children were taken three times, in 1996, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, the sample
consisted of 193 students (91 boys, 96 girls, six gender unknown); 189
students were involved in 1997 (90 boys, 95 girls, 4 gender unknown); and in
1998, 189 students participated (91 boys, 98 girls). Average age in 1998 was
11.3 years, with ages ranging from 11 to 13 years. The participants were
asked to rate all their classmates on a seven-point scale: dislike very
much, dislike much, dislike, ordinary, like, like much, and like very much.
