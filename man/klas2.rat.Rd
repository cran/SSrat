\title{
Example klas2 of rating data with names of the raters (assessed) and some missing values
}
\description{
Ratings with the names of the raters (and of the assessed as the members of the group assess each other). Furthermore, some of these ratings are missing (NA).\cr
The result of \code{readratdatafixed("<klas2.rat.txt>")}. A 3-point rating scale has been used. Numbers of assessors and assessed are equal (11). Each respondent is identified by a respname, schoolid, a group id and a respondent id. The rows contain the assessors, the columns contain the assessed.
When rater equals assessed (diagonal), the rating is NA.

\note{Rating data can be entered directly into a SSrat compliant dataframe, using \code{\link{edit}}. Colums needed are: "schoolid", "groupid", "respid", and for <n> raters "r01", "r02".."r<n>". Optionally, a column named "resplabel" can be entered, containing an extra identifier of the raters/assessed. The raters (assessors) are in rows and assessed in columns. For example: \cr
mydata=data.frame(schoolid=numeric(0), groupid=numeric(0), respid=numeric(0),\cr
       r01=numeric(0), r02=numeric(0), r03=numeric(0)); mydata=edit(mydata)\cr
       To allow for the combination of groups with different sizes in a single file, it is important to enumerate the n respondents from 1 to n, respectively use the columnnames r01 to rn for the received ratings. These column names are padded with a zero (r01, r02 etc.) to allow for easy ordening of these columns after a merge.
